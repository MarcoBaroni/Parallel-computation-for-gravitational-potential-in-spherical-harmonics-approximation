# Parallel computation for gravitational potential in spherical harmonics approximation

Final project for the Celestial Mechanics course in the Astrophysics and Cosmology master at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova.

I provide the stokes coefficients for Earth, Mars, Moon and Venus in the .txt files.

Is possible to read the final report of the project in the .pdf file.

I provide the Cython codes, both parallelized and non-parallelized, for the global potential model and the orbit integration.

The orbit integration is only relative to Earth.
